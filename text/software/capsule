Like the economic capsule hotels of Japan, Capsule provides customers a product with their dollar in mind. Web hosting costs an arm and a leg for small businesses and individuals. Very small businesses and individuals frequent so little traffic, competing web hosting services take advantage of them for big profits, then they have the audacity to jack the prices up down the road! Sabi Capsule was established with an economic model in mind to make web hosting accessible to anyone.
