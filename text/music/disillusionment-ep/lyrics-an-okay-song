Sitting at the computer,
And I don't know what to do.
I click on Steam,
But I click Chrome, too.

And it's okay.
Yeah, it's okay.

Will I watch Netflix,
Or will I play a game?
Doesn't matter much.
It's really one in the same.

It'll be okay.
Yeah, it'll be okay.

Decide on a show,
Then get settled in.
Wheel starts to turn
And the wifi signal dims.

Hope it's okay.
I hope it's okay.

Page never loads.
I have to go outside.
I really hate the Sun,
And I think I'd rather die.

It's not okay.
It's not okay.

Cruising down the street,
And I'm talking to my mom.
Things'll be smooth;
I won't be talking long.

And it's okay.
Yeah, it's okay.

Still cruising down the street
When a cop pulls behind.
Her lights are still off,
So I'm still doing fine.

It'll be okay.
Yeah, it'll be okay.

Lights turn blue
As the sirens start to ring.
She's pulling me over.
I didn't do anything.

Hope it's okay.
I hope it's okay.

"Step out the car.
Did you not see the sign?
Talking on the phone,
And you're obviously high."

It's not okay.
It's not okay.

The cop misjudged,
So I'm in the drunktank.
Luckily it's empty,
So I don't get shanked.

And it's okay.
Yeah, it's okay.

Lawyer shows up
For our first official date.
He doesn't have tie,
And he's running kind of late.

It'll be okay.
Yeah, it'll be okay.

The judge starts the trial,
But it doesn't last long.
He smacks down the gavel,
And he ends my song.

It's not okay.
It's never been okay.
